This is a website designed during the hackathon organised by IEEE DTU.

The theme of this website is carpool like a person who is located at somewhere and he has a car he can share his car among the persons who have same current location as well as same final destination so they can manage their cars one by one for their work. This will help them financially as well as help everyone by checking Air Pollution and many others.

With this theme we have created this website, The person will enter this person information and his account is created, after that he/she selects his current location and find other people who have same current location, from their he/she can opt the person with same destination and talk to them with the contact details provided.

We have implemented this idea but it is incomplete somewhat so we are still working on this project.
